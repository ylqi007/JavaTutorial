### What is the difference between field, variable, attribute, and property in Java?
* `Field`: A data member of a class. Unless specified otherwise, a field can be public, static, not static and final.
* `Attribute`: An attribute is another term for a field. It’s typically a public field that can be accessed directly. Let’s see a particular case of Array, the array is actually an object and you are accessing the public constant value that represents the length of the array.
* `Property`: It is also used for fields, it typically has getter and setter combination.
* `Variable`: An item of data named by an identifier. Each variable has a type, such as int or Object, and a scope. See also class variable, instance variable, local variable.
